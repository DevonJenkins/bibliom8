#### Description:
This app came about in an attempt to automate the more tedious aspects of book
record keeping at my library job. It's highly expandable, but for now it takes
in information related to a specific book, it formats that information, and then
adds it to a .txt file to then get copy and pasted into an email that will get
sent to bibliomation record keepers. 
apparently my description isn't long enough for cs50. In the interest of keeping
my description concise, I'm going to enter some randomized text.

## Ice Box
With this app I would really like to think about making it useful for other
people rather than just myself. The hope is that by adding certain features I
can make the app easier to access, more useful, and more customizable.
